 ## This Workbook Explained
 Magic the Gathering is a tabletop trading card game in which the goal is to reduce your opponents life points to zero. You accomplish this through playing various creatures and spells to take down the opponents creatures on the field and diretly attack your opponent. This workbook details the EDHREC ranking of cards from the Theros Beyond Death set.
 
The EDHREC ranking is assigned based on how successful a card is in the EHD/Commander format of play. This visualization shows the converted mana cost for each card by rank, and categorized by each rarity. For more information about converted mana cost please follow the link below
