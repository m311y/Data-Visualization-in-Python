 ## This Workbook Explained
Magic: The Gathering, also known as Magic or MTG, is not just a card game for teens; it is considered a critical thinking strategy game for all ages. In Magic, you are a wizard, or planeswalker, set out to destroy your opponent with items, spells, and fantasy creatures. It is also a trading card game, where players trade or battle for cards that they want for their own MTG deck.

The more powerful the spell, the more mana you need (that is, the more lands you need). The longer into the game you wait to play them, the more mana you will have to use them. Some spells also require the payment of additional resources, such as cards in play or life points. Some spells have effects that override normal game rules.

While your opponent is playing, if they attack and you cannot block them, then you begin to lose player life. You start off with 20. Whoever reaches zero first, loses the match. If a creature dies it is sent to the graveyard, and cards in the graveyard can only be resurrected if you have another card that says so. When you play a card, not only do you follow the effect it says but you can also attack with it.
 
This workbook details the EDHREC ranking of cards from the Theros Beyond Death set.
The EDHREC ranking is assigned based on how successful a card is in the EHD/Commander format of play. This visualization shows the converted mana cost for each card by rank, and categorized by each rarity. For more information about converted mana cost please follow the link below
